		<p>	My name is Austin Hammontree and I was born on July 9th, 1991. I have lived in Rockwall Texas for 23 years of my life and now I live in Garland Texas. I like watching sports and hanging out with my friends. My favorite pro team is the Chicago Cubs.</p>

		<p>I am attending a coding bootcamp at SMU trying to pursue a career in the tech industry. I have worked in the construction business ever since I was 13 years old and I am hoping to change that in the very near future. I have two dogs and one cat that give me more trouble than I'd like to admit. </p>
